# Gatsby Theme Carbon - Demos

## What is this?

This project provides a template for creating Platinum Demos (including demonstrations, walk-throughs and tutorials) for our various Cloud Paks and WebSphere Hybrid Edition. 

The content of this repository is intended to be help create clear and consistent content across all demos.

## How do I use it?

Check out our quick
[getting started](https://gatsby-theme-carbon.now.sh/getting-started) guide and
video!

`gatsby-theme-carbon` at it’s core relies on [mdx](https://mdxjs.com/) for page
creation. Check out the `src/pages` directory for some examples for using mdx.

A key feature of Gatsby themes is component shadowing. By simply placing a
component into the `src/gatsby-theme-carbon/components` location, you can
override components used by the theme. You can read more about component
shadowing
[here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/api-reference#component-shadowing).

You’re also free to make your own components and use them in your MDX pages.
