Instana automatically discovered the relationships between the services and correlated them into this dynamic graph. We can see how requests are moving through the application in real-time. Instana is able to do this because it tracks every request that flows through the application. <br/> <br/> We can tell there are some problems with the application because several of the services are highlighted in yellow and red. <br/> <br/> But, you wouldn’t normally be looking at the dashboard when something like this happens, so let me walk you through what it looks like from the SRE/IT operator’s point of view when an incident occurs. |\r\n| **Screenshot**         | <br/> ![robot_shop_starting_point](./images/robot_shop_starting_point_600.png) |\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n(Printer-ready PDF of demo script <a href=\"./100-Observability-Demo-Script.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>)\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n**[Go to top](#top)**\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>1 - Getting an incident alert</summary>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n| **1.1** | **Automatically assessing events and alerts** |\r\n| :---                   | :--- |\r\n| **Action**             | Click on the **Events** icon (triangle) in sidebar menu. |\r\n| **Narration**          | We’ve just gotten an alert from Instana that there has been a sudden increase in erroneous calls on our ‘discount’ service, which is part of the robot shop application. <br/> <br/> Although I don’t have it connected right now, the alert would show up via one of the configurable alert channels, like email, Microsoft Teams, Slack, and many others (<a href=\"https://www.instana.com/docs/events_alerts/alert-channels\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">full list</a>). <br/> <br/> It’s important to note here that you’re not getting alerts for just anything.
