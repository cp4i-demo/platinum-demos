To illustrate this, a customer’s refund process is automated. <br/> <br/> The capabilities used in this demo are workflow, decisions, and operational intelligence. |\r\n| **Demo outline** | Introduction <br/> 1. Model workflow <br/> 2. Execute workflow without straight-through processing <br/> 3. Change the workflow for straight-through processing <br/> 4. Execute workflow with straight-through processing <br/> 5. Monitor operational intelligence <br/> 6. Model decisions <br/> 7. Reduce manual work <br/> Summary |\r\n| **Before the demo** | **Requisition instructions** <br/><br/>**1 - Reserve environment on TechZone**. For IBMers and Business Partners with access to TechZone, reserve a pre-installed Cloud Pak for Business Automation OpenShift Demo Environment. <br/><br/> (Alternatively, you can install the demo into your own cluster. This is an advanced option. You will need own OpenShift-based cluster with the Cloud Pak for Business Automation installed and configured for access to all the required user interfaces.)<br/><br/>**1.1\t- Reserve your OpenShift cluster**<br/><br/>a. Go to https://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations/create/60a3f89394f6b10017929425<br/>This will reserve a preinstalled Cloud Pak for Business Automation V21.0.1-IF001 on Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud (ROKS) <br/>b.\tFill in the form, being sure to carefully read the information embedded about length of reservation and manual extension policy for the selected purpose.<br/>c. When selecting your data center location, use one with the lowest storage % available, even if this is further from your location. I find the latency is low to any data center around the world assuming you have a strong Internet connection. <br/>d.\tSubmit and wait for your cluster to be ready (read on to learn more about time expectations).<br/><br/> **Note**: If your reservation submission fails with an error, you may try a second time. If it fails again, please wait 30 minutes and check https://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations to see if the reservation was successful after all before you try again. For support and errors in Technology Zone, please slack #dte-techzone-support or email dte@us.ibm.com. <br/> <br/> Once your environment is ready, continue to the next steps below. <br/><br/> **1.2 - Wait for your cluster** <br/><br/>Cluster readiness expectations: Demo Pattern Preinstalled Clusters may be accessible via the IBM Cloud console and OpenShift web console in 20 minutes but the operator will still be deploying your CP4BA installation for at least 2 hours and generally not more than 5 hours. <br/><br/>How will you know when the cluster is ready? (**Note**: For issues with any of the steps below, go to the [Troubleshooting page](https://github.ibm.com/jgoodhue/cp4ba-roks-install/blob/master/Additional-files/troubleshooting-cluster.md).)<br/><br/>a.\tFirst, wait for an email with the subject Your OpenShift Cluster is ready on IBM Cloud in 30-60 minutes. <br/>- If you do not receive an email or to check on status, go to IBM Technology Zone's My Library -> My Reservations page.<br/>b.\tNext, use the email with the subject Your OpenShift Cluster is ready on IBM Cloud and click to open the console.<br/>- You may also use the IBM Technology Zone's My Library -> My Reservations page.<br/>c. This should take you to IBM Cloud console for your cluster.<br/>d.\tOnce you can get to your IBM Cloud cluster page, check to be sure the status shows Normal with a green check and an Ingress subdomain exists and do not proceed until they are.<br/>e.\tClick the OpenShift web console button in the upper right.<br/>f.\tFor Demo Pattern Preinstalled Clusters, the operator will take up to 6 hours to deploy. The last task within the operator is to generate a config map named icp4adeploy-cp4ba-access-info which you can access in the OCP Console under Workloads -> Config Maps or via the CLI. If this config map exists, then CP4BA should be ready.<br/><br/>**Note**: It is not recommended to change the password of cp4admin. Instead, create a new admin user if this is required.<br/><br/>**1.3 - Login to Cloud Pak for Business Automation**<br/><br/>All the URL and user and password information you need will be present in the icp4adeploy-cp4ba-access-info config map which you can access in the OCP Console under Workloads -> Config Maps or via the CLI. When you navigate to an interface and need to login, use Enterprise LDAP and cp4admin.<br/><br/>**Note**: Be sure to carefully follow the instructions in each section of the config map and open each of the mentioned URLs in your browser to accept the self-signed certificates or you will receive errors.<br/><br/>**Note**: For Automation Document Processing (ADP), in versions before V21.0.2, you MUST perform some steps BEFORE using it to manually import sample data. If you create a project before the import it will not be simple to recover. See the steps under Loading sample data for Automation Document Processing on https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-biz-automation/21.0.x?topic=deployment-installing-capabilities-by-running-script for details.<br/><br/>**2 - Install the demo.**<br/><br/>The following architecture diagram illustrates the products involved and the solution components when deployed in one possible hybrid cloud architecture:<br/><br/>![Comp view hybrid](./images/comp-view-hybrid.png)<br/><br/>The following diagram illustrates the products involved and the solution components when deployed to an OpenShift based architecture:<br/><br/>![Comp view ocp](./images/comp-view-ocp.png)<br/><br/><br/>We assume the following products are installed, up and running: <br/><br/>* IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation version 21.0.2<br/><br/>* Automation Foundation on OpenShift<br/><br/>* Business Automation Applications (including Studio and App Engine) on OpenShift<br/><br/>* Business Automation Navigator on OpenShift<br/><br/>* Business Automation Workflow (BAW) on VMs or OpenShift<br/><br/>* Operational Decision Manager (ODM) on OpenShift (as of the date committing this documentation, the ODM demo pattern is not supported)<br/><br/>* Business Automation Insights (BAI) on OpenShift<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n### Deploy the artifacts\r\n\r\n1.

Reduce manual work <br/> Summary |\r\n| **Before the demo** | **Requisition instructions** <br/><br/>**1 - Reserve environment on TechZone**. For IBMers and Business Partners with access to TechZone, reserve a pre-installed Cloud Pak for Business Automation OpenShift Demo Environment. <br/><br/> (Alternatively, you can install the demo into your own cluster. This is an advanced option. You will need own OpenShift-based cluster with the Cloud Pak for Business Automation installed and configured for access to all the required user interfaces.)<br/><br/>**1.1\t- Reserve your OpenShift cluster**<br/><br/>a. Go to https://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations/create/60a3f89394f6b10017929425<br/>This will reserve a preinstalled Cloud Pak for Business Automation V21.0.1-IF001 on Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud (ROKS) <br/>b.\tFill in the form, being sure to carefully read the information embedded about length of reservation and manual extension policy for the selected purpose.<br/>c. When selecting your data center location, use one with the lowest storage % available, even if this is further from your location. I find the latency is low to any data center around the world assuming you have a strong Internet connection. <br/>d.\tSubmit and wait for your cluster to be ready (read on to learn more about time expectations).<br/><br/> **Note**: If your reservation submission fails with an error, you may try a second time. If it fails again, please wait 30 minutes and check https://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations to see if the reservation was successful after all before you try again. For support and errors in Technology Zone, please slack #dte-techzone-support or email dte@us.ibm.com. <br/> <br/> Once your environment is ready, continue to the next steps below. <br/><br/> **1.2 - Wait for your cluster** <br/><br/>Cluster readiness expectations: Demo Pattern Preinstalled Clusters may be accessible via the IBM Cloud console and OpenShift web console in 20 minutes but the operator will still be deploying your CP4BA installation for at least 2 hours and generally not more than 5 hours. <br/><br/>How will you know when the cluster is ready? (**Note**: For issues with any of the steps below, go to the [Troubleshooting page](https://github.ibm.com/jgoodhue/cp4ba-roks-install/blob/master/Additional-files/troubleshooting-cluster.md).)<br/><br/>a.\tFirst, wait for an email with the subject Your OpenShift Cluster is ready on IBM Cloud in 30-60 minutes. <br/>- If you do not receive an email or to check on status, go to IBM Technology Zone's My Library -> My Reservations page.<br/>b.\tNext, use the email with the subject Your OpenShift Cluster is ready on IBM Cloud and click to open the console.<br/>- You may also use the IBM Technology Zone's My Library -> My Reservations page.<br/>c. This should take you to IBM Cloud console for your cluster.<br/>d.\tOnce you can get to your IBM Cloud cluster page, check to be sure the status shows Normal with a green check and an Ingress subdomain exists and do not proceed until they are.<br/>e.\tClick the OpenShift web console button in the upper right.<br/>f.\tFor Demo Pattern Preinstalled Clusters, the operator will take up to 6 hours to deploy. The last task within the operator is to generate a config map named icp4adeploy-cp4ba-access-info which you can access in the OCP Console under Workloads -> Config Maps or via the CLI. If this config map exists, then CP4BA should be ready.<br/><br/>**Note**: It is not recommended to change the password of cp4admin. Instead, create a new admin user if this is required.<br/><br/>**1.3 - Login to Cloud Pak for Business Automation**<br/><br/>All the URL and user and password information you need will be present in the icp4adeploy-cp4ba-access-info config map which you can access in the OCP Console under Workloads -> Config Maps or via the CLI. When you navigate to an interface and need to login, use Enterprise LDAP and cp4admin.<br/><br/>**Note**: Be sure to carefully follow the instructions in each section of the config map and open each of the mentioned URLs in your browser to accept the self-signed certificates or you will receive errors.<br/><br/>**Note**: For Automation Document Processing (ADP), in versions before V21.0.2, you MUST perform some steps BEFORE using it to manually import sample data. If you create a project before the import it will not be simple to recover. See the steps under Loading sample data for Automation Document Processing on https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-biz-automation/21.0.x?topic=deployment-installing-capabilities-by-running-script for details.<br/><br/>**2 - Install the demo.**<br/><br/>The following architecture diagram illustrates the products involved and the solution components when deployed in one possible hybrid cloud architecture:<br/><br/>![Comp view hybrid](./images/comp-view-hybrid.png)<br/><br/>The following diagram illustrates the products involved and the solution components when deployed to an OpenShift based architecture:<br/><br/>![Comp view ocp](./images/comp-view-ocp.png)<br/><br/><br/>We assume the following products are installed, up and running: <br/><br/>* IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation version 21.0.2<br/><br/>* Automation Foundation on OpenShift<br/><br/>* Business Automation Applications (including Studio and App Engine) on OpenShift<br/><br/>* Business Automation Navigator on OpenShift<br/><br/>* Business Automation Workflow (BAW) on VMs or OpenShift<br/><br/>* Operational Decision Manager (ODM) on OpenShift (as of the date committing this documentation, the ODM demo pattern is not supported)<br/><br/>* Business Automation Insights (BAI) on OpenShift<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n### Deploy the artifacts\r\n\r\n1.
