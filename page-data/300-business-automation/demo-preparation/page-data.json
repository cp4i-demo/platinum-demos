To illustrate this, a customer’s refund process is automated. The capabilities used in this demo are workflow, decisions, and operational intelligence.\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n**[Go to top](#place1)**\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>1 - Reserve environment on TechZone</summary>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n| **1 - Reserve your OpenShift cluster** |   |\r\n| :---         | :--- |\r\n| **Action** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsa. Go to https://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations/create/60a3f89394f6b10017929425<br/>This will reserve a preinstalled Cloud Pak for Business Automation V21.0.1-IF001 on Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud <br/>b.\tRead and complete the form<br/>c. **Suggestion**:When selecting your data center location, use one with the lowest storage % available, even if this is further from your location. <br/>d.\tSubmit and wait for your cluster to be ready.<br/><br/> **Note**: If your reservation submission fails with an error, try a second time. If it fails again, wait 30 minutes and check [reservations](https://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations) to see if the reservation was successful before you try again. For support and errors in Technology Zone, slack #dte-techzone-support or email dte@us.ibm.com. <br/> <br/> Once your environment is ready, continue to the next steps below. |\r\n|  | Alternatively, you can install the demo into your own cluster. You will need own OpenShift-based cluster with the Cloud Pak for Business Automation installed and configured for access to all the required user interfaces |\r\n| **2 - Validate your cluster** |   |\r\n| :---         | :--- |\r\n| **Action** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | While you may see your environment through the console within a few minutes, the operator will typically take 2 to 5 hours to complete the installation of the Cloud Pak for Business automation. <br/><br/>Cluster readiness expectations: Demo Pattern Preinstalled Clusters may be accessible via the IBM Cloud console and OpenShift web console in 20 minutes but the operator will still be deploying your CP4BA installation for at least 2 hours and generally not more than 5 hours. <br/><br/>To know when your cluster is ready: (**Note**: For issues with any of the steps below, go to the [Troubleshooting page](https://github.ibm.com/jgoodhue/cp4ba-roks-install/blob/master/Additional-files/troubleshooting-cluster.md).)<br/><br/>a.\tFirst, wait for an email with the subject Your OpenShift Cluster is ready on IBM Cloud in 30-60 minutes. <br/>- If you do not receive an email or to check on status, go to IBM Technology Zone's My Library -> My Reservations page.<br/>b.\tNext, use the email with the subject Your OpenShift Cluster is ready on IBM Cloud and click to open the console.<br/>- You may also use the IBM Technology Zone's My Library -> My Reservations page.<br/>c.On the IBM Cloud cluster page, check to be sure the status shows Normal with a green check and an Ingress subdomain exists.<br/>d.\tClick the OpenShift web console button in the upper right.<br/>e.\t The last task within the operator is to generate a config map named icp4adeploy-cp4ba-access-info which you can access in the OCP Console under Workloads -> Config Maps or via the CLI. If this config map exists, then CP4BA should be ready.<br/><br/>**Note**: It is not recommended to change the password of cp4admin. Instead, create a new admin user if this is required.<br/><br/> |\r\n| **3 - Login to Cloud Pak for Business Automation**<br/><br/>All the URL and user and password information you need will be present in the icp4adeploy-cp4ba-access-info config map which you can access in the OCP Console under Workloads -> Config Maps or via the CLI. When you navigate to an interface and need to login, use Enterprise LDAP and cp4admin.<br/><br/>**Note**: Be sure to carefully follow the instructions in each section of the config map and open each of the mentioned URLs in your browser to accept the self-signed certificates or you will receive errors.<br/><br/>**Note**: For Automation Document Processing (ADP), in versions before V21.0.2, you MUST perform some steps BEFORE using it to manually import sample data. If you create a project before the import it will not be simple to recover. See the steps under Loading sample data for Automation Document Processing on https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-biz-automation/21.0.x?topic=deployment-installing-capabilities-by-running-script for details. |\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n**[Go to top](#place1)**\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>2 - Install the Straight-through Processing demo</summary>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n2.1 - Determine your credentials<br/><br/>a. If using Cloud Pak for Business Automation as a Service:<br/><br/>a. You will use a single login to access BAS, BAW, ODM and BPC<br/><br/>- For ODM, you will need to create a service credential/account for basic auth credentials to invoke the API to Rule Execution Server<br/><br/>b. If you are deploying Refund Request on your own environment: <br/><br/>- Make sure you have a login to all required components.<br/><br/>2.2 Deploy ODM artifacts<br/><br/>a Login to Decision Center Business console<br/><br/>- On Library, click the import icon<br/><br/>- Choose and upload Refund Processing [main] YYYY.MM.DD_XX.zip<br/><br/>- Open the main branch, click Deployments and deploy to your Rule Execution Server (adjust the server within the deployment configuration as required)<br/><br/>- Return to the branch list and click the plus sign to create a new branch based on main named Reduce Manual Processing<br/><br/>- Import Refund Processing [Reduce Manual Processing] YYYY.MM.DD_XX.zip to the new branch and choose to replace the existing elements<br/><br/>- Deploy the new branch to Rule Execution Server as a second version<br/><br/>3.1 - Deploy BAW artifacts<br/><br/>a. Login to Workflow Center and navigate to Process Apps or Workflow Authoring in Business Automation Studio and navigate to Business automations -> Workflows<br/><br/>b. Import Refund_Request - YYYY.MM.DD_XX.twx<br/><br/>c. Open the Refund Request process app / project and navigate to Process App Settings -> Servers<br/><br/>d. Edit the settings for hostname, port, authentication and so forth for your ODM server<br/><br/>2.3 - (Optional) Open the BAI Generators team and add an appropriate user to the team<br/><br/>f. Create a new snapshot of the process application / project<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n3. Install the new snapshot to your Workflow Server unless you wish to run directly on Workflow Center's / Workflow Authoring's playback server (in SaaS, to support the optional BAI events, make sure the Workflow Server running the process app has BAI emitters enabled)<br/><br/>\r\n4. (Optional) Setup BAI data\r\n- Login to Process Portal / Workplace with the user specified in the above BAI Generators team\r\n- Click to start Generate Week 1 BAI Data RR v2 and wait for the spinner to complete in about 20 seconds\r\n- Do the same for Generate Week 2 BAI Data RR v2<br/><br/>\r\n5. (Optional) Deploy BPC artifacts\r\n- Login to Business Performance Center\r\n- Import two dashboards using RefundRequest (RR) – Week 1 - YYYY.MM.DD_XX.json and RefundRequest (RR) – Week 2 - YYYY.MM.DD_XX.json<br/><br/>\r\n- Adjust the monitoring sources to the deployed BAW snapshot for the dashboard and any charts that require it\r\n- Fix any charts that do not have data with the most likely error requiring is to select decimal (data > TG2 > pTime) –(float) in the Data item field which must sometimes be selected after the monitoring source is changed<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n6. Deploy Business Automation Studio artifacts\r\n- If using Cloud Pak for Business Automation as a Service\r\n        - Create an external automation service named Refund_Request_Application_Services, connect it to the appropriate BAW server, select the Refund Request process and Invoke Refund Processing ODM service flow and publish\r\n        - Export the external automation service as a ZIP from the Business automations -> Extenal section<br/><br/>\r\n- If you are deploying Refund Request on your own OpenShift environment\r\n        - Publish the workflow project's snapshot in Business Automation Studio to make the automation services available to applications\r\n        - Import the Refund Request application in Business applications using RefundRequest (RR) – App - YYYY.MM.DD_XX.json\r\n        - Create a new snapshot if needed and export the application as a ZIP<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n7. Deploy Business Automation Navigator artifacts\r\n- Login to Business Automation Navigator's admin desktop\r\n- Open and connect to the Application Engine Connection, sometimes called APPENGO\r\n- If using Cloud Pak for Business Automation as a Service, import both the automation service and application ZIP files\r\n- If you are deploying Refund Request on your own OpenShift environment, import the application ZIP file\r\n- Edit the details of the application and add appropriate teams to the Permissions table\r\n- Edit the desktop of your choice and on the Layout tab, add the application<br/><br/><br/>\r\nOnce your environment is ready, continue to the next steps below.\r\n| **Key demo considerations** | Please see [below](#key-demo-considerations). |\r\n| **How to get support** | Please direct any questions in  preparation for the demo to the [**#Techdemos-Automation-Support**](https://ibm.enterprise.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=techdemos-automation-support) Slack channel. |\r\n\r\n**[Go to top](#place1)**\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Key demo considerations\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>1 - Open the Refund Request Demo Launchpad</summary>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\nFollow these steps to the Refund Request Demo Launchpad, used to open all the user interfaces you will use in the demo.\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n| **1.1 - Navigator app** |   |\r\n| :---         | :--- |\r\n| **Action** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Open the **Navigator** app. Click on the **Refund Request** tile. <br/> <br/> **Note:** If you need the URL, open the OCP console under **Workloads** -> **Config Maps**.

If it fails again, wait 30 minutes and check [reservations](https://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations) to see if the reservation was successful before you try again. For support and errors in Technology Zone, slack #dte-techzone-support or email dte@us.ibm.com. <br/> <br/> Once your environment is ready, continue to the next steps below. |\r\n|  | Alternatively, you can install the demo into your own cluster. You will need own OpenShift-based cluster with the Cloud Pak for Business Automation installed and configured for access to all the required user interfaces |\r\n| **2 - Validate your cluster** |   |\r\n| :---         | :--- |\r\n| **Action** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | While you may see your environment through the console within a few minutes, the operator will typically take 2 to 5 hours to complete the installation of the Cloud Pak for Business automation. <br/><br/>Cluster readiness expectations: Demo Pattern Preinstalled Clusters may be accessible via the IBM Cloud console and OpenShift web console in 20 minutes but the operator will still be deploying your CP4BA installation for at least 2 hours and generally not more than 5 hours. <br/><br/>To know when your cluster is ready: (**Note**: For issues with any of the steps below, go to the [Troubleshooting page](https://github.ibm.com/jgoodhue/cp4ba-roks-install/blob/master/Additional-files/troubleshooting-cluster.md).)<br/><br/>a.\tFirst, wait for an email with the subject Your OpenShift Cluster is ready on IBM Cloud in 30-60 minutes. <br/>- If you do not receive an email or to check on status, go to IBM Technology Zone's My Library -> My Reservations page.<br/>b.\tNext, use the email with the subject Your OpenShift Cluster is ready on IBM Cloud and click to open the console.<br/>- You may also use the IBM Technology Zone's My Library -> My Reservations page.<br/>c.On the IBM Cloud cluster page, check to be sure the status shows Normal with a green check and an Ingress subdomain exists.<br/>d.\tClick the OpenShift web console button in the upper right.<br/>e.\t The last task within the operator is to generate a config map named icp4adeploy-cp4ba-access-info which you can access in the OCP Console under Workloads -> Config Maps or via the CLI. If this config map exists, then CP4BA should be ready.<br/><br/>**Note**: It is not recommended to change the password of cp4admin. Instead, create a new admin user if this is required.<br/><br/> |\r\n| **3 - Login to Cloud Pak for Business Automation**<br/><br/>All the URL and user and password information you need will be present in the icp4adeploy-cp4ba-access-info config map which you can access in the OCP Console under Workloads -> Config Maps or via the CLI. When you navigate to an interface and need to login, use Enterprise LDAP and cp4admin.<br/><br/>**Note**: Be sure to carefully follow the instructions in each section of the config map and open each of the mentioned URLs in your browser to accept the self-signed certificates or you will receive errors.<br/><br/>**Note**: For Automation Document Processing (ADP), in versions before V21.0.2, you MUST perform some steps BEFORE using it to manually import sample data. If you create a project before the import it will not be simple to recover. See the steps under Loading sample data for Automation Document Processing on https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-biz-automation/21.0.x?topic=deployment-installing-capabilities-by-running-script for details. |\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n**[Go to top](#place1)**\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>2 - Install the Straight-through Processing demo</summary>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n2.1 - Determine your credentials<br/><br/>a.
