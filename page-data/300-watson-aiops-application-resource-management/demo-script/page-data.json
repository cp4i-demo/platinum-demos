For example, we sell robots via our Robot Shop-branded ecommerce site.<br/><br/>**This is a list of all our business applications, which we are monitoring with Instana. Instana provides simplicity with its full-stack discoverability capabilities and an ability to trace every request end-to-end. This makes it easy to track each application’s health and performance. We can quickly see key information for each business application, including number of calls, latency, and the erroneous call rate.<br/><br/>Some users have been complaining about slowness and unpredictable performance issues with the Robot Shop Application recently. |\n| **Screenshot** | <br/> ![IMAGE PENDING](./images/quote-app.png) |\n\n| **1.2** | **Verify which hosts the app runs on** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Actions** | Click on **Robot Shop**<br/><br/>Then click the **Stack** button to see the dropdown<br/><br/>Click **Infrastructure** to see the hosts that Robot Shop runs on |\n| **Narration** | To accelerate our strategic digital transformation initiatives, our company has embraced cloud native architecture. Applications are build based on microservices and deployed to a Kubernetes-based infrastructure. Many lines of business deploy to and share a common infrastructure. This means that a node might have parts of multiple and different business applications on it. When one application suddenly has an increase in workload, it can affect the others as well. Since not all applications are built reliably, some may have unpredictable load patterns - especially during promotion events.<br/><br/>For example, our Robot Shop application has components running on two different nodes or “hosts” as they are known in Instana. |\n| **Screenshot** | <br/> ![IMAGE PENDING](./images/quote-app.png) |\n\n| **1.3** | **Shared Deployment Infrastructure** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Actions** | Click on the **worker2** host<br/><br/>On worker2’s summary screen, click the **Stack** button to see the dropdown<br/><br/>Click **Application** to see the other applications with components on worker2 |\n| **Narration** | Looking at one of the hosts, worker2, we can see that it has components of four different applications running on it.

Older applications were deployed to isolated environments, but modern apps are deployed to a highly shared, increasingly dense virtualized hybrid and multi-cloud environment. Hence getting a complete view is essential as resourcing decisions in one area will naturally impact another.<br/><br/>Turbonomic ingests configuration and operational data from various targets like Instana and combines all the information it has discovered into a common data model and represents it as a Supply Chain.<br/><br/>The Supply Chain provides the big picture, serving as an informative graphical organizer of the various entities in the IT estate. It also shows the implicit dynamic relationships, all the way from the application to its underlying infrastructure dependencies.<br/><br/>This quick visualization provids incredibly valuable information to the IT Ops teams. It helps to bridge the communication gap that often exists between the application owners and the infrastructure teams.<br/><br/>Okay, let’s explore the Supply Chain in a bit more detail here:<br/><br/>• Starting right at the top you have the Business Applications. Note this environment consists of 63 business applications<br/>• There are 544 key business transactions and 1000 services that are part of this estate.<br/>• The top three layers are called LOGICAL layers – they do not consume physical resources<br/>• The services are deployed to physical resources like JVMs or Operating Systems processes that run in a container or VM.<br/>• Going down the Supply Chain you can see the components that build up the lower layers of the application stack – including Database Servers, Storage Volumes and Hosts among others.<br/>• Going even further down the stack you can see how the virtualized resources could be part of. Virtual Data Center or part of a public Cloud region and availability zone.<br/>• Each circle in the supply chain represents a logical or physical entity.<br/>• The number inside is the count of the number of entities of this type<br/>• The ring of each entry indicates the percentage of pending actions<br/>• Green shows percentage of entities that have NO pending actions<br/>• Yellow shows entities that have efficiency pending actions<br/>• Red shows entities that have critical performance pending actions<br/>• Hover over the entity type to get actual counts of pending actions<br/>• The arrow from one entry to another indicates the flow of resource consumption<br/>• For example –a VM consumes resources from hosts and storage<br/>• You can see this environment consists of 972 Virtual Machines.<br/>• Clicking on an Entity Type will bring you to a detailed view into those entities.<br/><br/>Internally, the supply chain model is key to the optimization analytics that Turbonomic performs on the environment. It models each entity in the environment as part of an economic model – where some resources are buyers, and some are sellers. Each resource is allocated a budget and Turbonomic continually assesses the supply and demand of resources. If something is in short supply, its price goes up. This dynamic adjustment using a market-based approach means that Turbonomic can find the most efficient use of resources given performance needs and constraints. |\n| **Screenshot** | <br/> ![IMAGE TO COME](./images/incident-title.png) |\n<br/><br/>\n\n| **2.2** | **Discover which Top Business Applications require attention** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Action** | On the Turbonomic Home Page you will go to Top Business Applications</br/><br/>Navigate to Turbonomic home page<br/><br/>On the left, click on **Show All** |\n| **Narration** | Now let’s take a step back and review our application infrastructure.<br/><br/>Turbonomic uses the environment information discovered by Instanaand other sources, including other APM tools like DynaTrace, AppDynamics and New Relic to construct the first 4 layers of the Supply Chain.<br/><br/>The Top Business Applications Chart here shows the Top Business Applications that need your attention.<br/><br/>A Business Application is a logical grouping of Business Transactions. Business Transations use underlying services to complete their task. Services are deployed to Application Components that provide the runtime capabilities that enable a Service perform its designed function.<br/><br/>Also note that these two charts point out specific Applications & Transactions where there are SLO violations and where Average Response Times are trending in the wrong direction. |\n| **Screenshots** | <br/> ![IMAGE TO COME](./images/incident-title.png) |\n<br/><br/>\n\n| **2.3** | **On-Prem Global Optimization** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Action** | Click the **On Pren** tab at the top |\n| **Narration** | The Supply Chain now shows only the entities that are On Prem. The Cloud resources are obviously excluded.<br/><br/>The Top Cluster chart lists the most utilized clusters. The cluster-specific recommended actions appear alongside the respective cluster.<br/><br/>Let’s take a look at the Host Optimized Improvements chart. Note these are across several hundred VMs – 761 in this case. The chart compares the current utilization with a future state if all the suggested Pending Actions were executed.<br/><br/> This is where the value of a tool such as Turbonomic shines. Being able to compute these recommendations in a dynamic environment, at scale and in real time.<br/><br/>Notice that if these actions are executed the resulting goal will be an environment with much more equitable load distribution across all the VMs in the estate. This will naturally result in better application performance and lowers the risk of resource congestion. Keep in mind that this is being executed in accordance with the pre-defined compliance policies. |\n| **Screenshot** | <br/> ![IMAGE TO COME](./images/incident-title.png) |\n<br/><br/>\n\n| **2.4** | **Analyze the Performance Recommendations – View Pending Actions\n** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Action** | Select the **On Prem** tab at the top<br/><br/>Click **Show all** at bottom of **Pending Actions** widget |\n| **Narration** | Turbonomic is continually assessing the environment and using the supply and demand model to optimize. Since it is connected to Instana it is also aware of the real-time health and performance of the business applications. Turbonomic makes recommendations for changes in four categories:<br/><br/>1. those that are needed to assure performance<br/>2. those that will improve efficiency<br/>3. those that will prevent possible future problems<br/>4. those that are for compliance purposes.<br/><br/>The Performance recommendations are listed first, because they’re most critical. Turbonomic is telling us that making these changes will maintain our desired quality of service.<br/><br/>Let’s examine the Top Performance RESIZE recommendations are being suggested.<br/><br/>First enable the NEW VIEW<br/><br/>Then ADD FILTER–and set Action CategoryPerformance APPLY |\n| **Screenshots** | <br/> ![IMAGE TO COME](./images/incident-title.png) |\n<br/><br/>\n\nACTIONS and NARRATION actions dont seem to match\n\n**[Go to top](#place1)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>3 - SCOPE the analysis to Robot Shop</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **3.1** | **SCOPE to the Robot Shop Supply Chain** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Action** | Scroll down to an action that recommends scaling a virtual machine<br/><br/>Click the arrow on far right to expand details |\n| **Narration** | Now that we have a wholistic picture by exploring the Global View, let's zoom into our Robot Shop app. This is called SCOPING in Turbonomic, and allows you to focus on the subset of the workloads that we care about.<br/><br/>Clicking on the Robot Shop App renders a SCOPED VIEW –that now shows the Supply Chain specific to Robot Shop.<br/><br/>This enables us get a quick picture of the overall health of Robot Shop.<br/><br/>1.

These actions aren’t quite as critical from a performance perspective, but they are very important from a cost-savings and optimization perspective.<br/><br/>Here we can see several actions related to moving container pods to different nodes. Turbonomicgives us a summary explanation for why it is making the recommendations –and here it’s saying that we can consolidate workloads on fewer nodes than we currently have by suspending the “worker2” node and moving its containers to other nodes. This way we can improve efficiency and reduce the number of underutilized nodes that we have.<br/><br/>Again, if we had admin privileges in this demo environment we could execute the actions directly from Turbonomic. |\n| **Screenshot** | <br/> ![Relevant events](./images/relevant-events.png) |\n\n| **3.4** | **REPEATS STEP 3.3** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Action** | same as 3.3 |\n| **Narration** | same as 3.3 |\n| **Screenshot** | <br/> ![Relevant events](./images/relevant-events.png) |\n\n**[Go to top](#place1)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>4 - Towards self-healing and automating your action FINALIZE</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **4.1** | **Execute Actions** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Actions** | In the sidebar menu, click **Settings** |\n| **Narration** | No narration provided |\n| **Screenshots** | <br/> ![Search similar incidents](./images/search-similar-incidents.png) <br/>![Search similar incidents - Rating](./images/search-similar-incidents-rating.png) <br/>![Search results](./images/search-results.png) |\n\n| **4.2** | **Automate Action Execution** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Actions** | From the **Navigation Bar**, click **Settings** |\n| **Narration** | In addition to providing the full stack visibility and generating performance and efficiency recommendations to keep the applications healthy, the core value proposition of ARM is to TAKE THE ACTION and proactively resolve and avoid emerging resource bottlenecks. If this is done successfully then the users will be satisfied, ITOps teams will be happy as they have fewer alerts and tickets to respond to. As we’ve seen earlier the Pending ActionsCharts –provides a list of Actions that you can take to keep the system in a Desired State. These include the Recommend Actions –that you can exeute via a given workload controller like a hypervisor or other means. The Manual Actions are actions that you can execute directly from the Turbonomic user interface.This is very convenient as it avoids jumping across tools and associated process delays that require enlisting other tools and experts. The ability to execute an action is certainly powerful, however ideally it would be desirable to have AS MANY actions as possible executed PROACTIVELY & AUTOMATICALLY with no human intervention. Let’s explore how we can setup Automation Policies to do just that.From the Navigator Menu Click SettingsSelect PoliciesClick New Automation PolicyYou can create Automation Policies for various Entity Types here we will create an Automation Policy for the Application Componententity type. For Select Policy TypeClick Application ComponentNow let’s configure an Automation Policy for ApplicationComponents by filling out the Configure Application Component Policy panel as follows: Enter a name for our policy RobotShop App Components PolicyUnder Automation and OrchestrationClick Add ActionPopulate the Automation and Orchestrationpanel as follows:For Action TypeSelect –[ ReSize-Up-Heap, ReSize-Down-Heap; ReSizeUp-Thread-Pool; ReSize-Down-Thread-Pool; ReSize-Down-Connections; ReSize-Up-Connections ]For Action GenerationSelect Generate Actions<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>For Action Acceptance Select AutomaticYou can optionally add an Execution Schedule. So for example if you would like these actions to execute only during a pre-defined time window or day of week for example, then you can define those requirements in the Execution Schedule. Turbonomicwill queue up the actions and execute them accordingly.On the Automation and Orchestration panel Press SUBMIT Back on the Configure Application Component Policy panel Press SAVE AND APPLY |\n| **Screenshots** | <br/> ![Search similar incidents](./images/search-similar-incidents.png) <br/>![Search similar incidents - Rating](./images/search-similar-incidents-rating.png) <br/>![Search results](./images/search-results.png) |\n\n**[Go to top](#place1)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Summary</summary>\n\n<br/>\nUsing Instana and Turbonomic, we were able to easily identify changes needed to maintain quality of service, as well as improve efficiency, for our multiple applications which included components running on AWS and OpenShift.\n\nFirst, using Instana, we were able to discover the business applications and monitor their health.\n\nThen, using Turbonomic, we got specific recommendations on how to assure performance and improve efficiency of our operations.\n<br/><br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#place1)**\n\n</details>\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"ab477df56225a394c82eced682dd6683","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":1607},"frontmatter":{"title":"Proactively Assure Application Performance 300-level live demo","description":"Rapid incident resolution 300-level live demo","tabs":["Demo preparation","Demo script"]},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Proactively Assure Application Performance\n  300-level live demo\ndescription: Rapid incident resolution 300-level live demo\ntabs: [ 'Demo preparation', 'Demo script']\n---\n\nexport const Title = () => (\n  <span>\n    Proactively Assure Application Performance <br/> 300-level live demo\n  </span> );\n\n![banner](./images/Incident-Resolution-300-Script.jpg)\n\n<span id=\"place1\"></span>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Introduction</summary>\n<br/>\n\nIn this demo we will:<br/><br/>First, use Instana to discover the various business applications and get a quick view of their overall health.<br/><br/>Then, we’ll see how Turbonomic leverages the information from Instana and other workload controllers to provide recommendations for application performance & resource optimization.<br/><br/>Lastly, we’ll see how Turbonomic recommendations can be ***automatically*** executed via defined automation policies that effectively remove the need for human intervention.

These actions aren’t quite as critical from a performance perspective, but they are very important from a cost-savings and optimization perspective.<br/><br/>Here we can see several actions related to moving container pods to different nodes. Turbonomicgives us a summary explanation for why it is making the recommendations –and here it’s saying that we can consolidate workloads on fewer nodes than we currently have by suspending the “worker2” node and moving its containers to other nodes. This way we can improve efficiency and reduce the number of underutilized nodes that we have.<br/><br/>Again, if we had admin privileges in this demo environment we could execute the actions directly from Turbonomic. |\n| **Screenshot** | <br/> ![Relevant events](./images/relevant-events.png) |\n\n| **3.4** | **REPEATS STEP 3.3** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Action** | same as 3.3 |\n| **Narration** | same as 3.3 |\n| **Screenshot** | <br/> ![Relevant events](./images/relevant-events.png) |\n\n**[Go to top](#place1)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>4 - Towards self-healing and automating your action FINALIZE</summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n| **4.1** | **Execute Actions** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Actions** | In the sidebar menu, click **Settings** |\n| **Narration** | No narration provided |\n| **Screenshots** | <br/> ![Search similar incidents](./images/search-similar-incidents.png) <br/>![Search similar incidents - Rating](./images/search-similar-incidents-rating.png) <br/>![Search results](./images/search-results.png) |\n\n| **4.2** | **Automate Action Execution** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Actions** | From the **Navigation Bar**, click **Settings** |\n| **Narration** | In addition to providing the full stack visibility and generating performance and efficiency recommendations to keep the applications healthy, the core value proposition of ARM is to TAKE THE ACTION and proactively resolve and avoid emerging resource bottlenecks. If this is done successfully then the users will be satisfied, ITOps teams will be happy as they have fewer alerts and tickets to respond to. As we’ve seen earlier the Pending ActionsCharts –provides a list of Actions that you can take to keep the system in a Desired State. These include the Recommend Actions –that you can exeute via a given workload controller like a hypervisor or other means. The Manual Actions are actions that you can execute directly from the Turbonomic user interface.This is very convenient as it avoids jumping across tools and associated process delays that require enlisting other tools and experts. The ability to execute an action is certainly powerful, however ideally it would be desirable to have AS MANY actions as possible executed PROACTIVELY & AUTOMATICALLY with no human intervention. Let’s explore how we can setup Automation Policies to do just that.From the Navigator Menu Click SettingsSelect PoliciesClick New Automation PolicyYou can create Automation Policies for various Entity Types here we will create an Automation Policy for the Application Componententity type. For Select Policy TypeClick Application ComponentNow let’s configure an Automation Policy for ApplicationComponents by filling out the Configure Application Component Policy panel as follows: Enter a name for our policy RobotShop App Components PolicyUnder Automation and OrchestrationClick Add ActionPopulate the Automation and Orchestrationpanel as follows:For Action TypeSelect –[ ReSize-Up-Heap, ReSize-Down-Heap; ReSizeUp-Thread-Pool; ReSize-Down-Thread-Pool; ReSize-Down-Connections; ReSize-Up-Connections ]For Action GenerationSelect Generate Actions<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>For Action Acceptance Select AutomaticYou can optionally add an Execution Schedule. So for example if you would like these actions to execute only during a pre-defined time window or day of week for example, then you can define those requirements in the Execution Schedule. Turbonomicwill queue up the actions and execute them accordingly.On the Automation and Orchestration panel Press SUBMIT Back on the Configure Application Component Policy panel Press SAVE AND APPLY |\n| **Screenshots** | <br/> ![Search similar incidents](./images/search-similar-incidents.png) <br/>![Search similar incidents - Rating](./images/search-similar-incidents-rating.png) <br/>![Search results](./images/search-results.png) |\n\n**[Go to top](#place1)**\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Summary</summary>\n\n<br/>\nUsing Instana and Turbonomic, we were able to easily identify changes needed to maintain quality of service, as well as improve efficiency, for our multiple applications which included components running on AWS and OpenShift.\n\nFirst, using Instana, we were able to discover the business applications and monitor their health.\n\nThen, using Turbonomic, we got specific recommendations on how to assure performance and improve efficiency of our operations.\n<br/><br/>\n\n**[Go to top](#place1)**\n\n</details>\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/platinum-demos/platinum-demos/src/pages/300-watson-aiops-application-resource-management/demo-script.mdx"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1364590287","137577622","137577622","2102389209","2102389209","2456312558","2746626797","2746626797","3018647132","3018647132","3037994772","3037994772","768070550"]}
