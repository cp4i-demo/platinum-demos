Once you get an email confirming your access credentials, go to CoC's <a href=\"https://cmc.coc-ibm.com/aiops\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps cluster page</a>.<br/><br/>3. On the cluster page, you will see several clusters. You will be using the **Sabine** cluster. **IMPORTANT**: Watson AIOps is NOT currently multi-tenant. Therefore, only ONE USER can use the environment at a time. Otherwise, you risk overwriting/undoing other users’ demos. **You must reserve your timeslot**! The reservations are NOT self-enforcing, meaning it’s up to everyone to adhere to only using the demo during the time you’ve reserved and ensuring you finish up prior to the next person’s time slot.<br/><br/>4.\tReserve the cluster for a self-enablement session, following the steps below:<br/><br/>a. Go to the <a href=\"https://cmc.coc-ibm.com/calendar/sabine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">reservations calendar</a>.<br/>b. Make sure your reservation will not interfere with other reservations. Choosing the weekly calendar view at the top right makes it easy to see the duration of reservations, or you can click on reservations to see details.<br/>c. Reserve your timeslot and ensure you have sufficient time to set up, practice, and clean up. Reserve one or two hours, and choose self-enablement in the reservation pop-up. You don’t need any opportunity or revenue details to use the cluster for self-enablement.<br/><br/>5.
