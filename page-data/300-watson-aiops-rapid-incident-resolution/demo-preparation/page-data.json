To do so, you’ll reserve the cluster for self-enablement. You can also use this time to familiarize yourself with the navigation and flow of the demo.

Choosing the weekly calendar view at the top right makes it easy to see the duration of reservations, or you can click on reservations to see details.<br/>c. As a best practice, try not to schedule self-enablement directly after a customer demo reservation. You don’t want to accidentally kick a colleague out of the demo environment if their presentation runs long.<br/>d. Reserve one or two hours, and choose self-enablement in the reservation pop-up.
