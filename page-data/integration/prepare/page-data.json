To put this in a context of a business it is based on a car repair scenario. Most likely this is not an exact scenario for your client. It is up to you to make the linkage to your customer’s needs to support their customers.\n<br/>\n \nAll businesses have customers. Governments support citizens, B2B businesses have upstream and downstream businesses they deal with and most obviously B2C businesses have customers who need support. The demo works through a series of steps to: obtain and validate input information from a customer with a concern, open a case in Salesforce, attach the incoming information to the case, analyze the tone of the situation, and respond to the customer with the case number and expected date for resolution. This should be applicable to almost every business. Do the planning to understand your customer’s customer and what type of interactions they might have that fit this pattern.\n<br/>\n\nThis Demo Script has multiple tasks that each have multiple steps. In each step you have the details about what you need to do (Actions) and what you can say delivering this demo step (Talking Points). This Demo Script is a suggestion, but you are welcome to customize based in your sales opportunity. Most importantly practice this demo in advance.
