| Preparation| |
| :---         | :--- |
| **Scenario overview** | This demo shows how the IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation enables straight-through processing. To illustrate this, a customer’s refund process is automated. The capabilities used in this demo are workflow, decisions, and operational intelligence. |

<details>

<summary>1 - Reserve an environment on TechZone</summary>

<br/>

| **1 - Reserve your OpenShift cluster** |   |
| :---         | :--- |
| **Action**  | This will reserve a preinstalled Cloud Pak for Business Automation V21.0.1-IF001 on Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud <br/><br/>a.	Read and complete the form<br/><br/>**Suggestion**:When selecting your data center location, use one with the lowest storage % available, even if this is further from your location. <br/><br/>b.	Submit and wait for your cluster to be ready.<br/><br/> **Note**: If your reservation submission fails with an error, try a second time. If it fails again, wait 30 minutes and check [reservations](https://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations) to see if the reservation was successful before you try again. For support and errors in Technology Zone, slack #dte-techzone-support or email dte@us.ibm.com. <br/> <br/> Once your environment is ready, continue to the next steps below. <br/><br/>Alternatively, you can install the demo into your own cluster. You will need own OpenShift-based cluster with the Cloud Pak for Business Automation installed and configured for access to all the required user interfaces. |

| **2 - Validating your cluster** |   |
| :---         | :--- |
| **Action** | While you may see your environment through the console within a few minutes, the operator will typically take 2 to 5 hours to complete the installation of the Cloud Pak for Business automation. <br/><br/>**Cluster readiness expectations**: Demo Pattern Preinstalled Clusters may be accessible via the IBM Cloud console and OpenShift web console in 20 minutes but the operator will still be deploying your CP4BA installation for at least 2 hours and generally not more than 5 hours. <br/><br/>To know when your cluster is ready: (**Note**: For issues with any of the steps below, go to the [Troubleshooting page](https://github.ibm.com/jgoodhue/cp4ba-roks-install/blob/master/Additional-files/troubleshooting-cluster.md).)<br/><br/>a.	First, wait for an email with the subject Your OpenShift Cluster is ready on IBM Cloud in 30-60 minutes. <br/>- If you do not receive an email or to check on status, go to IBM Technology Zone's My Library -> My Reservations page.<br/><br/>b.	Next, use the email with the subject Your OpenShift Cluster is ready on IBM Cloud and click to open the console.<br/>- You may also use the IBM Technology Zone's My Library -> My Reservations page.<br/><br/>c. On the IBM Cloud cluster page, check to be sure the status shows Normal with a green check and an Ingress subdomain exists.<br/><br/>d.	Click the OpenShift web console button in the upper right.<br/><br/>e.	 The last task within the operator is to generate a config map named icp4adeploy-cp4ba-access-info which you can access in the OCP Console under Workloads -> Config Maps or via the CLI. If this config map exists, then CP4BA should be ready.<br/><br/>**Note**: It is not recommended to change the password of cp4admin. Instead, create a new admin user if this is required.<br/><br/> |

| **3 - Logging in to Cloud Pak for Business Automation** |   |
| :---         | :--- |
| **Action** | All the URL and user and password information you need will be present in the icp4adeploy-cp4ba-access-info config map which you can access in the OCP Console under Workloads -> Config Maps or via the CLI. When you navigate to an interface and need to login, use Enterprise LDAP and cp4admin.<br/><br/>**Note**: Be sure to carefully follow the instructions in each section of the config map and open each of the mentioned URLs in your browser to accept the self-signed certificates or you will receive errors.<br/><br/>**Note**: For Automation Document Processing (ADP), in versions before V21.0.2, you MUST perform some steps BEFORE using it to manually import sample data. If you create a project before the import it will not be simple to recover. See the steps under Loading sample data for Automation Document Processing [here](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-biz-automation/21.0.x?topic=deployment-installing-capabilities-by-running-script) for details.) |
