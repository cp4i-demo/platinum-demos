<br/>

![endpoint-salesforce-connect](./images/endpoint-salesforce-connect.png)

<br/>

5. Here you need to enter your Salesforce credentials. Insert the login URL into the connector account form as shown below. **IMPORTANT**: You **MUST** enter the **‘https://’** part as well – it won’t work if you just copy/paste from the Salesforce screen.

<br/>

![endpoint-salesforce-login-details](./images/endpoint-salesforce-login-details.png)

<br/>

6. To populate the Password field on the connector account screen you will need to concatenate the Password used to log into the Salesforce account with the Security Token received via email. For example if you Salesforce password is ‘myGreatPassword’ and your Salesforce security token is ‘2325jsdhew4312hs534dh’ then you should enter ‘myGreatPassword2325jsdhew4312hs534dh’ in the password field.

<br/>
