| **Before the demo** | This demo shows how to automate customer interactions using APIs and Integrations. To put this in a context of a business it is based on a car repair scenario. The demo works through a series of steps to: obtain and validate input information from a customer with a concern, open a case in Salesforce, attach the incoming information to the case, analyze the tone of the situation, and respond to the customer with the case number and expected date for resolution. This should be applicable to almost every business. Do the planning to understand your customerâ€™s customer and what type of interactions they might have that fit this pattern.
