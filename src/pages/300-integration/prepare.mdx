This demo shows how to automate customer interactions using APIs and Integrations.  To put this in a context of a business it is based on a car repair scenario.  Most likely this is not an exact scenario for your client.  It is up to you to make the linkage to your customer’s needs to support their customers.

The demo works through a series of steps to: obtain and validate input information from a customer with a concern, open a case in Salesforce, attach the incoming information to the case, analyze the tone of the situation, and respond to the customer with the case number and expected date for resolution. This should be applicable to almost every business.  Do the planning to understand your customer’s customer and what type of interactions they might have that fit this pattern.

This Demo Script has multiple tasks, each have multiple steps. In each step you have the details about what you need to do (**Actions**) and what you can say delivering this demo step (**Narration**). This Demo Script is a suggestion, but you are welcome to customize based in your sales opportunity. Most importantly, practice this demo in advance.  If the demo seems easy for you to execute the customer will notice this.  If it seems difficult for you to execute the customer will notice this as well.

Enjoy it and good sales!
