| Preparation | |
| :---         | :--- |
| **Scenario overview** | This demo shows how IBM Instana helps quickly identify and resolve an incident in a microservices-based application. The application in this demo is called Stan’s Robot Shop, and it uses various technologies such as Java, Python, and MySQL. |
| **Demo outline** | Introduction <br/> 1. Getting an incident alert <br/> 2. Inspect auto-correlated incident details <br/> 3. Debugging the incident by inspecting calls <br/> 4. Drill down with end-to-end traces <br/> 5. Confirm incident resolution was successful <br/> Summary |
| **Before the demo** | **Environment setup** <br/> •	Log into https://ibmdemo-instanaibm.instana.io. <br/> •	Set the time period to show an active incident, as detailed below: <br/> <br/> 1.	In the upper right, click the button showing the timeframe. <br/> ![timeframe](./images/1_timeframe.png) <br/> 2.	At the bottom of the pop-up, set the timeframe so that it begins at 25 minutes past the hour and ends at 35 minutes past the hour. It doesn’t matter which hour you pick. Click **‘Set Time.’** <br/> Note: Pressing 'enter' doesn’t work. You'll need to actually click the button. <br/> This will ensure you see normal behavior and then a sudden change when the incident begins at 0:30. <br/> ![time_range](./images/2_time_range.png) <br/> 3.	Check that the summary tab for the robot shop (**Applications** -> **Robot Shop** -> **Summary**) looks like this (seeing drop in call volume and spikes in errors and latency). <br/> ![robot_shop_summary](./images/3_robot_shop_summary.png) <br/> 4.	Click on **Events** on the sidebar menu and check that there are open incidents, including 'sudden increase in the number of erroneous calls' on the 'discount' service. <br/> ![open_incidents](./images/4_open_incidents.png) <br/> <br/> **Requisition instructions** <br/> Please see [below](#requisition-instructions). |
| **Key demo considerations** | The demo environment is set to automatically inject an error into the application once every hour. <br/> <br/> The cycle begins on the half-hour (so 9:30, 10:30, etc). You should see errors begin to show up a few minutes after this (around 32 or 33 minutes past the hour). <br/> <br/> The error will resolve itself and go back to a normal state after about 10 minutes. <br/> <br/> You can set the timeframe so that you can demo the active incident, even if your timing does not coincide with when the error cycle starts. See instructions above (under **Environment setup**). |
| **How to get support** | Please direct any questions in preparation for the demo to the [**#Techdemos-Automation-Support**](https://ibm.enterprise.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=techdemos-automation-support) Slack channel. |
