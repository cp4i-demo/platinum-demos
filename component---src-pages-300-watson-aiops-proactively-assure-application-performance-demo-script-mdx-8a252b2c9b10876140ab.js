If this is done successfully then the users will be satisfied, ITOps teams will be happy as they have fewer alerts and tickets to respond to. As we’ve seen earlier the Pending ActionsCharts –provides a list of Actions that you can take to keep the system in a Desired State. These include the Recommend Actions –that you can exeute via a given workload controller like a hypervisor or other means. The Manual Actions are actions that you can execute directly from the Turbonomic user interface.This is very convenient as it avoids jumping across tools and associated process delays that require enlisting other tools and experts. The ability to execute an action is certainly powerful, however ideally it would be desirable to have AS MANY actions as possible executed PROACTIVELY & AUTOMATICALLY with no human intervention. Let’s explore how we can setup Automation Policies to do just that.From the Navigator Menu Click SettingsSelect PoliciesClick New Automation PolicyYou can create Automation Policies for various Entity Types here we will create an Automation Policy for the Application Componententity type. For Select Policy TypeClick Application ComponentNow let’s configure an Automation Policy for ApplicationComponents by filling out the Configure Application Component Policy panel as follows: Enter a name for our policy RobotShop App Components PolicyUnder Automation and OrchestrationClick Add ActionPopulate the Automation and Orchestrationpanel as follows:For Action TypeSelect –","[ ReSize-Up-Heap, ReSize-Down-Heap; ReSizeUp-Thread-Pool; ReSize-Down-Thread-Pool; ReSize-Down-Connections; ReSize-Up-Connections ]","For Action GenerationSelect Generate Actions",Object(b.b)("br",null),Object(b.b)("br",null),Object(b.b)("br",null),Object(b.b)("br",null),Object(b.b)("br",null),Object(b.b)("br",null),"For Action Acceptance Select AutomaticYou can optionally add an Execution Schedule. So for example if you would like these actions to execute only during a pre-defined time window or day of week for example, then you can define those requirements in the Execution Schedule. Turbonomicwill queue up the actions and execute them accordingly.On the Automation and Orchestration panel Press SUBMIT Back on the Configure Application Component Policy panel Press SAVE AND APPLY")),Object(b.b)("tr",{parentName:"tbody"},Object(b.b)("td",{parentName:"tr",align:"left"},Object(b.b)("strong",{parentName:"td"},"Screenshots")),Object(b.b)("td",{parentName:"tr",align:"left"},Object(b.b)("br",null)," ",Object(b.b)("img",{parentName:"td",src:"./images/search-similar-incidents.png",alt:"Search similar incidents"})," ",Object(b.b)("br",null),Object(b.b)("img",{parentName:"td",src:"./images/search-similar-incidents-rating.png",alt:"Search similar incidents - Rating"})," ",Object(b.b)("br",null),Object(b.b)("img",{parentName:"td",src:"./images/search-results.png",alt:"Search results"}))))),Object(b.b)("p",null,Object(b.b)("strong",{parentName:"p"},Object(b.b)("a",{parentName:"strong",href:"#place1"},"Go to top")))),Object(b.b)("details",null,Object(b.b)("summary",null,"Summary"),Object(b.b)("br",null),"Using Instana and Turbonomic, we were able to easily identify changes needed to maintain quality of service, as well as improve efficiency, for our multiple applications which included components running on AWS and OpenShift.",Object(b.b)("p",null,"First, using Instana, we were able to discover the business applications and monitor their health."),Object(b.b)("p",null,"Then, using Turbonomic, we got specific recommendations on how to assure performance and improve efficiency of our operations."),Object(b.b)("br",null),Object(b.b)("br",null),Object(b.b)("p",null,Object(b.b)("strong",{parentName:"p"},Object(b.b)("a",{parentName:"strong",href:"#place1"},"Go to top")))))}m.isMDXComponent=!0},OIbQ:function(e,t,a){e.exports={bxTextTruncateEnd:"last-modified-date-module--bx--text-truncate--end--123zi",bxTextTruncateFront:"last-modified-date-module--bx--text-truncate--front--3xeKz",text:"last-modified-date-module--text--24m-4",row:"last-modified-date-module--row--2BquN"}},QH2O:function(e,t,a){e.exports={bxTextTruncateEnd:"PageHeader-module--bx--text-truncate--end--mZWeX",bxTextTruncateFront:"PageHeader-module--bx--text-truncate--front--3zvrI",pageHeader:"PageHeader-module--page-header--3hIan",darkMode:"PageHeader-module--dark-mode--hBrwL",withTabs:"PageHeader-module--with-tabs--3nKxA",text:"PageHeader-module--text--o9LFq"}}}]);
